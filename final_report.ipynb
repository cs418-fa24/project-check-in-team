    "\n",
    "The U.S. housing market is influenced by a multitude of factors—historical housing prices, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., mortgage rates, GDP), seasonal variations, and even political cycles. For real estate investors, identifying locations with the highest potential returns and understanding the trajectory of property values is critical. This project aims to forecast property value trends at the zip code level and determine the top areas to invest in over a one-year horizon. "

    "**Observations**:\n",
    "- The chart displays the average house prices over the years from around 2000 to 2025.\n",
    "- Each line represents house prices for a different season (Fall, Spring, Summer, Winter).\n",

    "**Assumptions**:\n",
    "- The dataset used for this chart includes sufficient historical data on seasonal average house prices, possibly sourced from a reliable real estate database.\n",
    "- The chart aims to show whether there’s a seasonal effect on house prices, looking for distinct price differences between seasons over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**:\n",
    "- Similar Trends Across Seasons: All four seasons display similar patterns in price increases and decreases over time, with minimal differences between them, especially after 2015.\n",
    "- Peaks and Troughs: There’s a peak in prices around 2005, a dip after 2007, a steady low around 2010, and then significant growth from around 2015 onward.\n",
    "- Minor Seasonal Differences: Seasonal variation appears minor, with all seasonal lines staying close to each other across the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "- The average house prices appear to follow a consistent pattern across seasons, with no significant seasonal effect observed in recent years. Prices largely vary based on broader economic cycles rather than seasonal factors, suggesting that, at least in this dataset, seasonality doesn’t have a strong impact on average house prices over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elections vs House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the years 2000-2008, during the Republican Administration under Geoge W Bush, it was considered as the period of economic expansion. Interest rates were low, the availability of credit was easy, and minimal regulations around mortgages led to a housing boom which encouraged the investments in real estate. The American Dream Downpayment Act made it easier for people to own homes.\n",
    "- \n",
    "But during the global financial crisis in 2008, this steep decline in home prices across the US as foreclosures surged and the housing dema d dropped, that created the economic downturn.\n",
    "- In 2008-2016, during the Democratic Administration under Obama, the ARRA (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) in 2009 aimed to stimulate the economic growth and support recovery, ideally it tried to stabilize the situation which can be seen from the graph. The recovery started to restore confidence in the economy. Priority was also given to affordable housing and assistance, though they had a limited effect on curbing the overall rise in house prices due to high ongoing demand and slow supply growth\n",
    "- During the Republican administration in 2016 - 2020 under Trump underwent through a major policy, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that had provisions for lowering taxes for some individuals, which boosted disposable income for many and eventually made the housing market bit more welcoming, which made the house prices rise and that can be seen from the upward trend.\n",
    "- During 2020-2021, mortgage rates were at their all time low, also covid brought demand in housing which caused a rise in demand, subsequently rise in property rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prediction based on recent elections:**\n",
    "- In the 2024 fall, the feds have decreased the interest rates for the first time after 2020, also the elections held in November 2024, the republican party has come into power, substituting the democrats. Predicting the previous trends, it can be projected to be increasing ahead, since fed rates are low, this leads to lower mortgage rates increasing the housing demand and higher house rates.\n",

    "- To predict future prices, we use the most recent 12 months of prices for each zip code. We predict the next price, append it to the input data, remove the oldest price, and repeat this process until we have predictions for the desired time range.\n",
    "- We experimented with different feature degrees to evaluate model performance, specifically testing degree = 1 and degree = 2.\n",
    "- Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed an inverse relationship between mortgage rates and housing prices, prompting us to include mortgage rates as a feature. We conducted hypothesis testing to evaluate whether their inclusion significantly impacts model performance by comparing metrics of models trained with and without mortgage rates.\n",

    "**Results**\n",
    "- The model achieves a directional accuracy of 47% and an average absolute difference of 55 when predicting house prices one year ahead.\n",

    "## **Conclusion** \n",
    "\n",
    "This project leveraged a comprehensive dataset of U.S. housing prices, enriched with mortgage rates and contextualized by economic and political factors, to forecast property value changes and identify high-potential investment opportunities. Through ARIMA analysis, we found that using the entire dataset yielded optimal results for forecasting future prices. Our linear regression model with degree=1 provided the best balance of simplicity and performance, with the inclusion of mortgage rates marginally improving accuracy. Additionally, our analysis confirmed a significant inverse relationship between mortgage rates and housing prices, aligning with economic theory. With these insights, we identified several promising zip codes for future investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our approach successfully identified promising zip codes for future investments, we acknowledge the limitations of simpler models. Advanced machine learning techniques and the integration of additional features—such as crime rates, unemployment levels, etc—are necessary to further enhance predictive accuracy. Zillow’s estimates, for instance, leverage neural network models and richer data inputs.\n",
